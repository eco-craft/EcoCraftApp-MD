## Project Summary
Eco Craft is an Android mobile application designed to detect waste through a user’s camera or gallery and provide creative, eco-friendly craft ideas based on the detected waste. The app aims to promote environmental awareness by encouraging users to recycle and repurpose waste materials.

Key features of the app include:
- **Login and Registration**: Secure user authentication through a login and registration system, allowing users to create and manage their profiles.
- **Waste Detection**: Use the camera to take photos of waste, which the app then identifies and categorizes.
- **Craft Recommendations**: Based on the type of detected waste, the app suggests craft ideas to help users repurpose the waste into creative projects.
- **User Profiles**: Users can create and edit profiles, manage their information, and update their profile pictures.
- **Post Craft Ideas**: Users can share their own craft ideas, including images and descriptions, for others to explore.

## Tech Stack
Eco Craft is built using the following technologies:
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The architecture pattern used for separating concerns and improving code maintainability.
- **Navigation Component**: Used for managing navigation between different screens using fragments.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for making API requests and fetching data (e.g., waste detection and craft ideas).
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for developing the app.
